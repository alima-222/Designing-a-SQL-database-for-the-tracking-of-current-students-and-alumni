# Designing-a-SQL-database-for-the-tracking-of-current-students-and-alumni

The objective of this project is to design and implement a relational database system for job tracking, catering to the needs of both current students and alumni. The system aims to address the challenges of accessing centralized job-related information by utilizing MySQL as the underlying database platform. It adheres to core relational database design principles and normalization techniques to ensure data integrity and optimize performance. Additionally, the system incorporates advanced features, such as triggers and stored procedures, to enhance operational efficiency and maintain consistency. Ultimately, the project seeks to improve communication between employers and candidates, fostering professional growth and engagement in alignment with the universityâ€™s mission.
